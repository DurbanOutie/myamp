It was time for me to do another Toon Skin and what better subject than the looniest of all Toons - Bugs Bunny. Fully skinned including AVS, Custom Cursors, MB and a MBinner for those people with the MikroAMP Plugin (available here:http://www.skinmaster.co.uk/mikroamp)

*updated* - Dec.3rd,2001:  Corrected a bug with the mb.ini file and made some decorative corrections. 

Shouts out to my forum buds :)   

I hope you enjoy this skin!
